        <h3><u>A few of our favorite Mental Health sites</u></h3>


        <p>More than ever before, your mental health is and should always be a top priority.  With no end in tangible sight, 
            it can feel very isolating and hard to deal with on your own.  However, you are VERY much not alone.  There are 
            many ways that can help you and others around you be your best selves as we continue to navigate the new normal.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>I personally have found myself loving my therapist that I met thru 
                    <a href="https://latinxtalktherapy.com/" target="_blank">Lantinx Talk Therapy.</a>
                </li>

                <br>

                <li>My best friend shared with me recently that she found her therapist thru 
                    <a href="https://openpathcollective.org/city/chicago/" target="_blank">Open Path</a> and has, 
                    as she puts it, "Found a sense of peace."
                </li>

                <br>

                <li>If you are way more into a digital way of things and not into Therapy(I get it), there are apps such as 
                    <em>Headspace</em> and <em>Calm</em> to name a few. This article in 
                    <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/7-self-care-apps-to-help-you-stay-balanced-in-2019-15643553" 
                    target="_blank">Bustle</a> can name a few more as well if you find yourself interested!

    <h3><u>How you can give back during Covid-19</u></h3>

    <p>Even if you're quarantined at home, there are still many ways to get involved and give back, including donating money 
        or supplies, volunteering virtually, and checking in on people who might need support. There is always something you 
        can do to help others. And by helping others you will also help yourself.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.helpguide.org/articles/healthy-living/coronavirus-how-to-help-give-back.htm" target="_blank">
                HelpGuide</a> has some great suggestions that allow you to put your personal gifts and/or side hobby to 
                work!
            </li>

            <br>

                <li>One of my personal favorite places to volunteer is the
                    <a href="https://www.chicagosfoodbank.org/coronavirus-updates/" target="_blank">Greater Chicago Food 
                        Depository</a> if you are a local.
                    </li>

                    <br>

                    <li>If you are in a position where you can simply donate money, you can look into your local 
                        <a href="https://www.chicagocovid19responsefund.org/" target="_blank">Covid-19 Response Fund</a> 
                        thru their designated website.
                    </li>
